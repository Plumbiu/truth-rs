# truth-rs

> Inspired by [truth-cli](https://github.com/truthRestorer/truth-cli), powered by [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).

Currently, some codes in rust are not fully optimized.

The code for the web part is still under development.


# Dev

```bash
cargo watch -x 'run -- web --dev'
# cargo watch -x 'run -- web # if you don't want devDependencies
pnpm dev:web
```
